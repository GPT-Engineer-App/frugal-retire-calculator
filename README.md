# frugal-retire-calculator

Create a retirement calculator for frugalists. You can enter your net income, expenses and savings rate. It has "more settings" as well. Make it fully functional.

Add a title and teaser text. Generate a cute 3d image that illustrates savings with a piggy bank, money and coins on one side and expenses with a car, house, technology etc. on the other.
